Training a yolo analytics model to detect objects.

This is a code that detects objects (in this case, buoys) via the webcam which then outputs a decision to move the body with respect to the detection parameter. For example if a red bouy is detected on the rgh side of the image, then the code will print "move left".

The ultimate goal of this model is to create a system for autonomous maritime navigation system that will make navigation free for all.

This is Atticus Pushing a new version
